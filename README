StreamerGrabber
===============

This project is a simple twitter client that queries the twitter streaming api. However before it can be used the app must be registered on the twitter dev website (https://apps.twitter.com/). Once you have registered an application, generate an access token for yourself and proceed to populating the start.sh file like thus:

APPTOKEN = Consumer Key
APPSECRE = Consumer Secret

USRTOKEN = Access Token
USRSECRE = Access Token Secret

Then specify the keywords that you want to track seperated by commas:

TRACK="twitter,music"

Adjust any other variables that you feel are necessary eg colours

Then run start.sh and view the resulting windows, You will be streamed the relevant tweets.

Enjoy.
